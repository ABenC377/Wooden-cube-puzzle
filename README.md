# Wooden-cube-puzzle

My partner recently bought a puzzle, which is a 5x5 wooden cube broken into 25 pieces which have the following squigly shape:

X X 

  X X X

These 25 pieces can be placed together to remake the cube.

We spent way too long trying to work out how to do it, but couldn't think of any smart way to go about it.  Therefore, I decided to make this program to solve it by brute-force before my partner could (I won).
